I am a solution architect working in the oil and gas industry. I like to design and build data management solutions for the companies I work with. My background is with relational databases and web application development in the .NET framework using C#. I tend to experiment with a broad range of tools and libraries and build small prototypes. Lately i have been trying to get my head around programming in Python and using machine learning algorithms. In my free time I code and go for long runs.

This site was built with Jekyll and is hosted on github.
