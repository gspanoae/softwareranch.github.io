# Hack Summit 2016 (Part 1)
The hack.summit was last week and it was an amazing conference. So many great speakers and great stories shared. It was one of the largest online conferences with over 25k attendees, the chat rooms were buzzing as you can imagine when so many start talking. I didn`t get to see all the sessions live, I am hoping to catch up on the ones i missed soon. These are my notes from some of the sessions I attended.

## Orion - Founder Heroku
[@orionspeaks](https://twitter.com/orionspeaks)

He started Heroku in 2007 when the "Cloud" was a new thing and everyone was just getting the hang of it.
Amazon launched their cloud earlier (AWS). The new technology which enabled the cloud was virtualisation and at that time it was something new. Docker wasn`t invented yet so there was some work to do to get things up and running.

Orion and his mates **built Heroku in order to solve the problem of Devops for everyone**, by building their own cloud solution an online editor which people could use to learn they faced a lot of Devops issues and they did not want other people to go through the same issues. His attitude was and still is and I`m paraphrasing here **"I rather be a starving entrepreneur than someones code mule"**. Heroku was very successfull it was one of the biggests exists for YCombinator.

The current state of the union is that cloud is great but it is making the internet very centralised. Also the current market
is very competitive everyone has their own cloud solutions which they are pushing, so he wouldn't do cloud at this point.
He **recommends finding people or markets which are underserved and solving a problem for them**. Then he went on to present a vision of what it would look like if we tried to decentralise the internet again. Which also means having a simple backend architecture rather then the complicated backends that the current cloud servers have. For security it would mean that you would bring your security along with you, like you do in real life with your passport or drivers licence. A lot of new startups have emerged who try to figure out what this would look like and try to do this based on block-chain technology.
(I`ll insert some examples here)
For example blockchain db, where you would store data in the open. A potential issue that this raises is monetisation, who would pay for this? At the moment we are paying for it by ignoring does ads google and everyone tries to spam us with in the corner of the browser, how would this work in a decentralized web?

Then he goes on to explain how he got started with all this. They did a consultancy to pay for their passion project, but then started hiring people to do the work so they would have time for their passion project. That backfired because they ended up running a business with no time for their own projects. So it`s better just to focus on one thing then trying to split yourself between multiple projects.

They initally built an editor but people started to misuse it and deploying their production applications on the platform because it was easier to use then the other cloud providers. Orion and friends soon realised that there might be an opportunity here and split the business between the editor and hosting solutions. They soon ended up in a bad place and had to decide on which one they should cut, it was a tough decision when they decided to cut the editor and put all their weight behind the hosting solution. The editor was their baby, it was the reason they started the whole thing in the first place.
It is hard to pivot and you should only do it when necessary, it`s not something you want to do every month, not if you are serious about your solution.
