I want to start with a fun app I found recently, you should check it out here [Devrant.io](https://www.devrant.io/feed/recent). 
It's a lot of fun and the community is great, I hope they can keep it like this.
It's built by one person David Fox you can find him on twitter [@dFoxinator](https://twitter.com/dfoxinator)


And here is a list of the latest stuff i looked in the past month:

#### News / Blog Posts

* [Data Engineering Shortage](https://blog.stitchdata.com/new-research-were-in-the-middle-of-a-data-engineering-talent-shortage-bdd59673608c#.ejh1mbiwf) 
New research suggests that we are in shortage of data engineers. The people that build ETL`s and data pipelines for data scientists and analysts to use.
* [Optimization Algorithms](http://www.lizsander.com/programming/2015/08/04/Heuristic-Search-Algorithms.html) Liz Sanders has great blog full of insightful resources.
* [Standford scientits map poverty](http://news.stanford.edu/2016/08/18/combining-satellite-data-machine-learning-to-map-poverty/) - 
data visualisation created by stanford scientists which attempts to map poverty using satellite data and machine learning algorithms.
This method is a lot cheaper then traditional home survey methods, and they seem to get good results with it. They only did if for a couple of countries at this point.
* [Machine Learning Podcasts](http://www.iamwire.com/2016/08/the-7-best-data-science-and-machine-learning-podcasts/140931) this blog post has a list of machine learning and data science podcasts.
I mention the ones i subscribed to below. Check it out you might like them.
