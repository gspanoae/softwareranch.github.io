#### Data Science

I am currently reading [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods For Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)
it`s an interactive and open source book which aims to bring you quickly up to speed with the PyMC library and the types of problems that can be addressed by using Bayesian Statistics and Python.

I read the [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/) book. 
This is a very good introduction to text processing, text analytics, machine learning and general python development. 
There is a lot to take in with this book and i can see myself returning to it in the future and using it as reference. 
There is so much great content here, i really enjoyed the chapters on tagging (chapter 5), classification (chapter 6) and extracting information (chapter 7) which were the most relevant for me. Some of the examples need to be tweaked a little bit since the book was written in 2009 and they are a bit out of date.

#### Trading

I have been binging on the [Bloomberg Masters in Business](http://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/masters_in_business) podcast hosted by Barry Ritholtz. I find there is so much good content here, he interviews so many great people.
This is a list of some of the episodes which stood out, best of the best i guess, but i found all of them really well produced and having amazing content. 
They should have made these longer:

* [Jack Bogle](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2016-03-11/interview-with-jack-bogle-masters-in-business-audio) on Indexing, Vanguards history, the US economy. He is a legend, kudos for Barry for getting him on the show.
* [Meb Faber](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2015-03-21/cambria-cio-meb-faber-masters-in-business-audio-) on quantitative trading also [Emanuel Derman](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2016-02-26/interview-with-emanuel-derman-masters-in-business-audio) the original quant trader
* [Jack Schwager](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2014-10-04/masters-in-business-market-wizards-by-jack-schwager-audio) author of the "Market Wizzards" book.
* [Mario Gabelli](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2015-10-30/an-interview-with-mario-gabelli-masters-in-business-audio-) on value investing, one of the original people who wrote the book on it.
* [Michael Covel](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2016-01-08/interview-with-michael-covel-masters-in-business-audio-) on trend following strategies
* [Bill Janeway](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2016-01-04/an-interview-with-bill-janeway-masters-in-business-audio-) on venture capital and investing in tech startups
* ... and many other great interviews


I also finished listening to the Market Wizzards book by Jack Schwager. This is a classic book that everyone should read. Even though it was written in 1990 and most of the interviewed traders talk about the markets in the 1980`s i think the subjects discussed are still valid today, 26 years later.
