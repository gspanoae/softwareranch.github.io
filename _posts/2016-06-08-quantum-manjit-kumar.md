This is a small book review of the Quantum book by Manjit Kumar, I really enjoyed it and thought I'd write down a few ideas.
I was always fascinated by quantum physics, about it`s spooky nature. With friends we would 
sometimes discuss anecdotes or some of it's theories over a late night beer session. 
Mostly we would talk nonsense but we would always feel inspired by the great physicists and their theories. 
The book really helped to put everything in order in my mind, it structured the events that took place at the turn of the 
century which lead to so many discoveries, it was a golden age of physics.

### Max Planck and the quanta

Electric companies wanted a better light bulb so they asked 
Planck to look into it, if the amount of light can be increased while the amount of heat produced can be decreased.
The phenomenon was known as black body radiation,Planck started looking at it and he discovered something amazing. 
That electromagnetic energy is released in discrete units which he called quanta. 
He also formulated an equation for all this E (Energy) = h (Planck`s constant)*V(nu, the frequency of the radiation)
At the turn of the century the general opinion on physics was that there is nothing left to discover, 
that everything was known about nature and all that remained is to refine
the measurements so they are more precise. 
Planck with his new postulate kicked the door open for new discoveries to be made and shook up the status quo.
