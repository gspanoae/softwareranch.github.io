This is a weekly set of links to resources I found interesting related to various topics.
Inspired by the [CFA Institute`s financial blog](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org). Links to a lot of interesting financial podcasts can be found at
[the original linkfest link](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2015/11/04/essential-listening-accurate-forecasters/).

This weeks theme seems to be related to Computing and Artifical Intelligence

 * This week on Startalk Radio we are [Gazing Into the Future](http://www.startalkradio.net/show/gazing-into-the-future-with-ray-kurzweil/). Neil DeGrasse Tyson interviews futurist, artificial intelligence guru [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil). A very interesting conversation emerges on the singularity or "nerd rapture" as some call it and how technology and human life will converge in the next decade by the years between 2020-2030.

 * This is an oldie but goldie the [IEEE Computing Lives](https://www.computer.org/web/computing-lives) podcasts series from 2008 discusses some of the pioneers of the computing revolution and the events that led to the creation  of many of the technologies we might take for granted.

 *  The [Talking Machines Podcasts](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/) a series which tackles the issues around artificial intelligence. A very well produced podcast which aims to explain and popularise the techniques behind machine learning and artifical intelligence.

 * [a16z](http://a16z.com/podcasts/) is a podcast from [Andreessen Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz) and company which aims to shed light on the latest trends in technology. In this episode they try to explain the current state of virtual reality and what is in order for the immediate future [Mapping the future of virtual reality](http://a16z.com/2016/02/26/a16z-podcast-mapping-the-future-of-virtual-reality/)

 * I have been spending a lot of time lately on the [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile) youtube channel, which has a series of really well produced videos on everything related to computing, with a focus on the old school stuff and the basics of computation. In this episode [The Golden Key: FBI vs Apple iPhone](https://youtu.be/6RNKtwAGvqc) the problem of the Apple creating a golden key is tackled.
