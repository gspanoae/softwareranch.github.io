# What is Microservices architecture?

> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

# Which are the design principles?
Each architectural style is nothing else than a set key principles which will shape the landscape of your technical solution.

## Cohesion and Autonomy
In other words each Micro-Service will need to do a well define job, support a core purpose in an autonomous way, basically will validate the Single Responsibility Principle from OOP ("A class should have only one reason to change").
