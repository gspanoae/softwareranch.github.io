I don't know much about John von Neumann so you probably shouldn`t listen to me, I will probably get all the facts wrong you should probably
 go and read wikipedia instead (Link to Neumann).
I have always been insipred by this great man, he made so many contributions to science. It seems mind boggling how he 
could contribute to so many diverse fields,
physics, computing, economics, mathematics and biology he was a man of so many talents.
Everytime i open up a computer and look at the motherboard i think of him, oh that`s the neumann architecture, i remember when i first learned this fact it seemed so incredile to me. Now i just take it for granted but think about it your desktop, laptop, mobile phone and any smart gadget you have they all follow the Neumann architecture.
