Joel talked about how content is managed on Wikipedia and contrasted with how it is managed on stackoverflow.
His talks central theme was about how to manage online communities and how you can have nice things.

Key lessons on managing online communities:

 * Make nice things
 * Delete the garbage you can't allow everything
 * Balance the rules to get the best content, constant explanation of the rules is necessary
 * Have metrics always measure make sure you are making progress
